        title: "Defending Founder Rights and Equity in Saudi Corporate Law",
        type: "text",
        content: `Subject: Defending Founder Rights and Equity in Saudi Corporate Law

**1. Vesting and “Resetting” Service Time**

*   **Key Question:** Can a partner or investor force a founder to “reset” their vesting start date to the date of a new entity’s registration (e.g., a Saudi LLC) despite prior service and agreements (e.g., a SAFE note)?
*   **Legal Principle:** Vesting is a contractual mechanism, not a statutory requirement under Saudi Companies Law. However, standard commercial practice and principles of *good faith* (Shariah principle) apply.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   If a founder has been working and has a prior agreement (like a SAFE note or a previous service contract) referencing their start date, that date should be respected as the "Vesting Commencement Date."
    *   Creating a new vehicle (the Saudi LLC) does not automatically negate prior service unless the founder explicitly agrees to a new start date in the new Shareholders' Agreement (SHA).
    *   **Defense:** Argue that the economic reality of the relationship began in Jan 2024 (or whenever service started). Resetting vesting without additional consideration (compensation) could be challenged as *unjust enrichment* for the company/other partners, as they are getting 2 years of "free" risk-mitigation.
    *   **Spanish Amendment:** If the Spanish amendment explicitly extended a *cliff* (waiting period), it does not logically imply a reset of the *vesting* (earning) schedule, unless explicitly stated. Confusing the two is a negotiation tactic, not a legal mandate.

**2. Article 80 of Labor Law as a "Bad Leaver" Trigger**

*   **Key Question:** Is it standard/safe to link "Bad Leaver" status (stripping equity) to Article 80 of the KSA Labor Law?
*   **Legal Principle:** Article 80 allows an employer to terminate an employee *without notice or indemnity* for specific grave reasons (e.g., assault, forgery, disclosure of secrets, *failure to follow instructions*).
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **HIGH RISK:** Using Article 80 as a "Bad Leaver" definition is extremely dangerous for a minority founder who is also an employee/manager.
    *   **Subjectivity:** Article 80 includes vague grounds like "failure to perform essential duties" or "insubordination." A majority shareholder (or CEO with executive power) could manufacture a reason to fire the founder under Article 80, thereby triggering the Bad Leaver clause and confiscating shares.
    *   **Recommendation:** Bad Leaver clauses should be restricted to objectively verifiable events:
        *   Final, non-appealable criminal conviction (involving fraud/dishonesty).
        *   Material breach of the SHA/Founders Agreement *that is not cured* after notice.
        *   Voluntary resignation (sometimes).
    *   **Defense:** Insist that Article 80 termination is an *employment* matter, not an *ownership* matter. Stripping property (shares) based on a manager's subjective firing decision is aggressive and potentially unenforceable if challenged as un-Islamic (gharar/uncertainty or unjust taking).

**3. "Fake Debt" and Paid-in Capital**

*   **Key Question:** If the AoA says capital is "Paid in Full," but a side agreement says it is owed, which prevails?
*   **Legal Principle:** The Articles of Association (AoA) registered with the Ministry of Commerce is the definitive public record.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   **Public Order:** Statements in the AoA (like "Capital has been paid in full") are deemed accurate by the regulator. Contradicting them in a side letter implies that the AoA filing was false (a potential violation of the Companies Law, penalties apply for providing false info).
    *   **Debt Validity:** If you sign a side agreement acknowledging a debt for capital that the AoA says is paid, you are creating a personal contractual obligation. The other partner could sue you on the *contract*, even if the AoA says otherwise.
    *   **Defense:** Do not sign a document stating you owe capital if the official record says you paid it. It creates a liability where none legally exists vis-a-vis the state. It essentially converts your equity into a debt obligation.

**4. Nominal Value Buyback**

*   **Key Question:** Is it fair to buy back shares at Nominal Value (e.g., 10 SAR/share) when the company is worth millions?
*   **Legal Principle:** Freedom of contract allows partners to set buyback terms. However, Shariah principles discourage *ghaban* (gross unfairness) and unjust enrichment.
*   **Analysis:**
    *   Buying back a founder's shares at Nominal Value (Par Value) instead of Fair Market Value (FMV) is a standard *penalty* for Bad Leavers.
    *   **The Trap:** If "Bad Leaver" is defined loosely (e.g., Article 80), then the Nominal Value buyback becomes a tool for the majority to expropriate the minority's value for pennies.
    *   **Defense:**
        *   Fight the *Bad Leaver definition* first (as above).
        *   If you are a "Good Leaver" (terminated without cause, death, disability), the buyback MUST be at Fair Market Value.
        *   Ensure there is a "Leaver" category (intermediate) or that unjustified termination treats you as a Good Leaver.

**5. Cure Periods**

*   **Key Question:** Is 10 days enough to cure a breach?
*   **Analysis:**
    *   10 days is very short for substantive business breaches. 30 days is standard.
    *   For "payment" breaches, 10-15 days is common.
    *   For "performance" or "material breach" (e.g., not delivering code), 30-60 days is more reasonable to allow for rectification.

**Summary Strategy for Rommaana:**
1.  **Refuse the Vesting Reset:** Stand on the SAFE note and 2024 service start.
2.  ** decoupling Article 80 from Bad Leaver:** Limit Bad Leaver to Criminal Acts/Fraud only.
3.  **Reject the Debt Acknowledgement:** Rely on the AoA's "Paid in Full" statement.
4.  **Demand Fair Market Value:** For any exit that isn't a proven crime.`,
